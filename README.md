A pathfinding visualizer which finds the quickest path between 2 nodes, maneuvering around obstacles with the Djikstra Algorithm! Hover above a node and hit 'S' to designate it as the starting point. Similarly, press 'E' to mark an endpoint. Press 'Space' to start the algorithm and see the pathfinding take place! 🎯
